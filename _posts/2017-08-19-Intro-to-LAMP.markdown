L-A-M-P is Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

So what? Why should you care? What does that mean?

LAMP is a "stack" of products you can use to build your stuff. A "stack" is a toolbox. The tools in the LAMP toolbox are Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. You'll have other tools as well: HTML, JavaScript, CSS. Oh, speaking of JavaScript, it's part of another little toolbox called AJAX. Wanna hear something really confusing? Okay, you know how I just said you can use any kind of Linux and you don't really need to use MySQL for the "M"? AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript AND XML but you might never actually use XML because you'll use JSON (another acronym!) instead but if you said you were using AJAJ nobody would understand what you meant even if it was easy to say. I'd explain what the JSON acronym stands for but then explaining that can be (really) confusing even if you've been programming for a while. 

You don't have to use MySQL, you can use another database. Until recently, I always used MySQL. Now I use MariaDB. You'll also see PostGRE, I think it's called. 

Use whatever distro ("version" or "flavor") of linux you like. 

The order in which you install doesn't really matter but it does affect (just a wee bit) how you install them.
