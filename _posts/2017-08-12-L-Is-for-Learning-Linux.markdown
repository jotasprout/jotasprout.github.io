For the longest time, I used only a small handful of commands. And when I say "handful" I mean, probably, with fingers to spare.

## Licking the Linux Learning Curve
* Directory Structure (the love child of M.C. Escher and Lewis Carroll but you'll get used to it)
* Navigating the aforementioned directory structure (it's easy)
* Permissions (locks and keys)
* Ownership (any tenant/user can have permissions, ownership is different)
* Users

## Lesson 1: I am Root

You are a user. There are things you can't do. "Root" is the Great, Grand, Almighty Admin. A "super user" is a user with root-like privileges.

### References, Sources, and Such

This great post

https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2241497

is filled with educational information posted by civilized people (unlike those bullies at StackOverflow). It referred me to

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions

I was already familiar with permissions but have to constantly refresh. I have a feeling constant practice will quickly remove the need to look things up so often.

Also, you'll need this ...

but I'm going to expand on that because you'll find the same folder names pieces of paths throughout the system and it can get confusing when somebody says, "install it in the x folder" and you're like, "Which x folder?"

I'm going to add this, too, for now
