As with most, if not all, of these posts, this one is inspired by trying to "fix" a problem after moving to a VPS. The problem isn't the VPS and, in fact, isn't really a problem. I just keeping learning I must do a lot of work that cPanel and shared hosting used to take care of for me. Had I known how much I'd learn through practical work, I'd have switched a long, long time ago. 

I've learned--repeatedly--that Permissions are important. Unfortunately, I already had a "P is for" post and, now that I think about it, P isn't for PHP because PHP is for ... dude, what is PHP for ...?

According to [Wikipedia][php-wikipedia], "PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page." [PHP.net][php-net] explains it is now a recursive acronym (an acronym that contains itself) standing for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

Chown = Change owner of the file, folder, folder and everything in it

Chmod = Changes permissions ... that's all I know at the moment.
