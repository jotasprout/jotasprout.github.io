This tutorial is a combination of several I used. Each of them had awesomeness the others didn't. It took me a while to get my own site consistent so it used an elegant system of classes, objects, security, PDOs. This will be the culmination of several months of hard work making my site something I'm proud to show instead of just a frankenstein's monster of body parts from multiple tutorials.

In some cases, I just had to start from scratch after learning from their tutorials so that I could create my own classes for the unique needs and purpose(s) of my app.

In most cases, the unique awesome stuff from each had something to do with additional security. As with many stages of my app's development and my growth as a site/server administrator and app developer, I had to learn which things were obsolete, deprecated. That's the bad thing about the interwebs and tutorials--you can rarely be sure not only what is correct but what is simply too old.
