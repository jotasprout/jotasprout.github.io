I just learned that PDO and MySQLi are alternatives to each other. Googling "PDO vs MySQLi" found oodles of resutls, including one fresh from 2017.

From everything I gather, PDO is the way to go. It takes some effort to climb a bit of a learning curve, but is more than worth it when it comes to elegance, efficiency, and security. Also, there's the bonus of being able to take those PDO skills to other databases besides MySQL.
