This post is based on two of the all-time greatest tutorials I've ever read. These two tutorials are so important, so essential to your life as a programmer, so well-written, and so helpful, I'll include them in this year's Books of the Year list.

Object Oriented Programming is, in and of itself ... it should be the first thing you learn immediately after the very basics. Even in basic HTML and CSS. 

I still refer back to [Learn Object Oriented Programming in PHP][oop-php] all the time. Not because it isn't good enough for a normal person to learn from effectively the first time--just because I need to keep going back. I still haven't done it enough for it to stick. No matter what language you know or will focus on, this tutorial applies to OOP.

PDO stands for PHP Data Object and is a specific, security-focused type of OOP and [The Only Proper PDO Tutorial][pdo-oop is outstanding.
