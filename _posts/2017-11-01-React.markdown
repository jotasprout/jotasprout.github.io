Starting the 30 Days of React book. Today is day #1. What I learned and/or reviewed today was:

React is a javascript framework.

You use React by including javascript files in your html.

react.min.js
react-dom.min.js
babel.min.js

React apps are made of components. Components can contain other components. Components are "composable."

You use React "exports" in your app's javascript.

Babel, I think translates the ract stuff into the app's results/products from React's "virtual DOM" to the actual DOM.
